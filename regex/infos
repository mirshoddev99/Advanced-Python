Metacharacters are characters with a special meaning:
All meta characters: . ^ $ * + ? { } [ ] \ | ( )
Meta characters need need to be escaped (with ) if we actually want to search for the char.

. Any character (except newline character) "he..o"
^ Starts with "^hello"
\$ Ends with "world\$"
* Zero or more occurrences "aix*"
+ One or more occurrences "aix+"
{ } Exactly the specified number of occurrences "al{2}"
[] A set of characters "[a-m]"
\ Signals a special sequence (can also be used to escape special characters) "\d"
| Either or "falls|stays"
( ) Capture and group

Compilation Flags¶
ASCII, A : Makes several escapes like \w, \b, \s and \d match only on ASCII characters with the respective property.
DOTALL, S : Make . match any character, including newlines.
IGNORECASE, I : Do case-insensitive matches.
LOCALE, L : Do a locale-aware match.
MULTILINE, M : Multi-line matching, affecting ^ and $.
VERBOSE, X (for ‘extended’) : Enable verbose REs, which can be organized more cleanly and understandably.
